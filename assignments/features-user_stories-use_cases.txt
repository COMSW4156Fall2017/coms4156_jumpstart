In addition to the current roles (teacher and student), we will add the role of "TA". TAs will have permissions to:

  1. Sign into a course during its open attendance period (shared with students)
  2. Open/close a course's attendance period (shared with teachers)
  3. Collect/view attendance records (shared with teachers)

So the TA will be a hybrid role between teachers and students.

Teachers will be granted a new related permission as well:

  1. Add TAs to courses
  2. Remove TAs from courses

By adding the TA role, we're proposing adding or amending the following roles:
  Add TA Role:
    Description: An assistant to the Teacher, a TA is enabled to do light administrative work for particular courses, granted and subsidiary by the Teacher. A TA also has their own attendance record for a course, as they can attend or skip classes themselves.
  Amend Teacher Role:
    Description: An instructor who uses the app to collect and view attendance records for the students and TAs in their courses. May delegate responsibilities to TAs.

By adding the TA role, we’re proposing adding the following user stories:
  Title: As a TA, I need to be able to open attendance windows to allow students and TAs to mark their presence
  Title: As a TA, I need to be able to close attendance windows to prevent students and TAs from continuing to be able to mark their presence for this attendance window, for example if class has begun and the grace period is over.
  Title: As a TA, I need to be able to mark my own attendance in a course for an attendance window so the Teacher and other TAs will know that I was present.
  Title: As a teacher, I need to be able to add and remove TAs from the course to reflect who is and is not a TA of the course so they can manage attendance windows.

By adding the TA role, we’re proposing amending the following user stories:
  Previously: “Title: As a Teacher, I need to be able to manage the attendance windows so that students can mark themselves as present and I can see whether or not they’ve attended later.”
    Change to: “Title: As a Teacher, I need to be able to manage the attendance windows so that students and TAs can mark themselves as present and I can see whether or not they’ve attended later.”
  Previously: “Title: As a Teacher, I need to be able to see students’ attendance records for a course in order to judge how many classes they’ve attended.”
    Change to: “Title: As a Teacher, I need to be able to see students’ and TAs’ attendance records for a course in order to judge how many classes they’ve attended.”

  Title: As a teacher, I want to mark a student (or TA) as either present or absent for a particular attendance window manually to correct for accidents such as forgetting to sign in or a student cheating and marking themselves present despite not actually being present.
