In addition to the current roles (teacher and student), we will add the role of
"TA". TAs will have permissions to:

  1. Sign into a course during its open attendance period (shared with students)
  2. Open/close a course's attendance period (shared with teachers)
  3. Collect/view attendance records (shared with teachers)

So the TA will be a hybrid role between teachers and students.

Teachers will be granted a new related permission as well:

  1. Add TAs to courses
  2. Remove TAs from courses

We will also add the ability for Teacher's to modify attendence records after
they have been initially recorded.

Teachers will be granted a new permission:
  1. Toggle a student's attendence record for a particular attendance window.
