Jumpstart Project for Columbia University's COMS 4156

** All of this will be re-written into complete English sentences. **

# Local Installation
Local installation will be on a virtual machine (Ubuntu 14.04).  Motivation: Ensure maximum compatibility with testing (Travis CI) and deployment environment.  If you have to do something special in your environment, then you will need to do it on deployment.

Side benefits:
- Eliminate unique installation hassles of Mac vs. Windows.  Replaces them with common Linux installation headaches.
- You can destroy and rebuild the VM without affecting the rest of your computer.
- It is a common thing you will be asked to do in other classes.
